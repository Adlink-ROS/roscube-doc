Massive Flashing
################

``nvmflash.sh`` supports **massive flashing**, which means you can attach multiple ROScube Pico and run nvmflash.sh to flash the image to multiple boards at the same time.

.. warning:: 

    Please do not attach **different models** (e.g. ROScube Pico NX and ROScube Pico Nano) to your computer when using ``nvmflash.sh``.
